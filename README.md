# odin-recipes  
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This is my first project utilizing HTML. It will be a project only utilizing HTML with the objectives of gaining experience with HTML and to demonstrate proficiency in HTML. This project will be revisited in the future as I learn to utilize CSS and Javascript in tandem with HTML.</p>
<h1>What is this project </h1>
<p>This project is what the title implies, it will list recipes for certain foods and it will be organized in an aesthetically pleasing and easily to navigate manner.</p>
