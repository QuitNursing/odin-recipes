    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>4 slices bacon, or more to taste</li>
            <li>4 slices sturdy white bread</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons salted butter</li>
            <li>2 (6 ounce) salmon fillets</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt to taste</li>
            <li>1 pinch seasoned salt (such as Lawry'sÂ® Mediterranean Herb)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons mayonnaise, or to taste</li>
            <li>4 leaves Bibb lettuce</li>
            <li>4 slices tomato</li>
            <li>2 slices Havarti cheese</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Step by Step Instructions</h3>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned and extra crispy, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels.</li>
            <li>While the bacon is cooking, place bread on a baking sheet and use a pastry brush to lightly coat the tops with olive oil.</li>
            <li>Toast bread, without turning, under the preheated broiler until crispy (like a crouton), about 4 minutes, watching carefully as it toasts. Remove from the oven and set aside.</li>
            <li>Add remaining oil to a large skillet with butter. Season salmon with salt and place skin-side down in the hot pan. Cook until skin is crispy and salmon is nearly cooked through, about 6 minutes. Flip and cook until top side of fish is just browned, 2 to 3 minutes more. Remove from the pan, discard skins, and sprinkle with seasoned salt.</li>
            <li>Spread 1 tablespoon mayonnaise on the untoasted side of a bread slice. Top with 1 salmon fillet, 1 tablespoon pesto, 2 lettuce leaves, 2 tomato slices, 2 slices bacon, 1 slice Havarti cheese, and a slice of bread, toasted-side out. Repeat to assemble remaining sandwich.</li>
        </ol>
